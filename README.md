Here I will collect all my thoughts, raw data and analysis for my research on badges in education. I will take as a prominent example [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for two reasons:

* StackOverflow (SO) is a very successful Q&A (Question and Answer) website. It hosts the worldâ€™s largest programming community and is still growing. SO occupies about the 60th position in the world rankings of websites. It is the [flagship of StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/sites#traffic) a network of almost 100 Q&A websites. To study the dynamics of SO one can learn much about the effects of gamification elements, e.g. the interplay between reputation points and badges.
* I can scrap all the necessary data for substantiating my research question with the well documented [API of StackExchange](http://api.stackexchange.com/) (SE). There is even an R package `stackr` available, which can easily used and functions as a client for the Stack Exchange API.
