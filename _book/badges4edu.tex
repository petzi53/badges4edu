\section{Categorization of Badges}\label{categorization-of-badges}

I need to download all types of badges with their description and for
further investigation to categorize them.

\subsection{Badges for different
activities}\label{badges-for-different-activities}

The badges are grouped according to the necessary activities to get
them. The different types of badges can be seen on
\href{https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges}{help page for badges}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  Question badges
\item
  Answer badges
\item
  Partication badges
\item
  Moderation badges
\item
  Other badges
\item
  Documentation badges
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Badges from different
sources}\label{badges-from-different-sources}

Another differentiation is the point of origin the badges come from.
Even though all badges are generated automatically by the system, there
are two principal sources to get them. There are two different entities
responsible for awarding badges.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  There are badges you can get by just doing a certain action once or a
  needed number of times.
\item
  And there are badges you get only after some community action.
\end{enumerate}

I call the first type \texttt{user} and the second type
\texttt{community} badges.

\textbf{Examples for \texttt{user} badges:}

Name: ``Civic Duty'' (Vote 300 times). Name: ``Enthusiast'' (Visit the
site each day for 30 consecutive day)

Some of the \texttt{user} badges are only available after some threshold
value is reached and a certain privileges is granted. For instance
voting up needs 15 and voting down 125 reputation points.

\textbf{Examples for \texttt{community} badges:}

Name: ``Favorite Question'' (Question favored by 25 users) Name:
``Popular Question'' (Question with 1000 views).

There are also badges tied with certain events, like moderator election,
working with the beta version, meeting employees at an event etc. Mostly
these badges are in my categorization \texttt{user} badges, but you
cannot get them at any time, even if you would have the required
privileges.

The badge system of Stack Overflow is a dynamic system. When the website
was launched (Spetember 15, 2008) it did not start with all 91 badges
which are listed today (May 21, 2018). Some of the badges were added
during the history of the website but other are not awared anymore. Some
of those badges which are not functional anymore are retired badges
(e.g. ``Analytical'', for visiting all sections of the FAQ). This means
you will still see some veteran users with these badges. Other badges
(all three documentation badges for instance) are withdrawn, e.g.~they
were even deleted from those user accounts they were awarded earlier. I
call these two groups of badges \texttt{event} and \texttt{dead} badges.

To sum up there are 4 point of origins for badges:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  Badges from user action = \texttt{user} badges
\item
  Badges from community action = \texttt{community} badges
\item
  Badges from some action during a specified occurence = \texttt{event}
  badges
\item
  Badges where the point of origin is not interesting anymore as they
  are now non-funtional = \texttt{dead} badges
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Badges with different degrees of
difficulty}\label{badges-with-different-degrees-of-difficulty}

Badges are ranked by their difficulty. According to their level of
difficulty users are awared with bronze (relatively easy), silver
(moderately difficult) or gold (difficult) badges. User can see those
groups of badges separated by lines on the
\href{https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges}{Stack Overflow website}. On
this page one can also inspect how many time each badge was awarded.

There is also a special group of badges intimately linked with
reputation of the user's expertise. These \texttt{Tag\ Badges} also come
with different degrees of difficulty.

I will focus in my research on those badges where users are mainly
responsible. Those are the badges where I can show if users are
motivated to strive for them.

\textbf{Visit the site each day for {[}\ldots{}{]} consecutive days.

The \texttt{user} badges are of utmost importance for my research. Most
of these badges are granted for quality assurance work on the website
and are not linked with reputation points. They are -- from a systemic
perspective -- important for the dynamic of the website and maintain
respective raise the qualitiy of the platform and their ecological
sustainability.

When I can show that people are striving to get \texttt{user} badges --
even when they are not linked with reputation points -- than it is
evident that badges are some additional (motivational) factors for the
community development.

\chapter{Methods}\label{methods}

We have finished a nice book.

\chapter{Appendix}\label{appendix}

\section{Material from original bookdown
files}\label{material-from-original-bookdown-files}

\subsection{Prerequisites}\label{prerequisites}

This is a \emph{sample} book written in \textbf{Markdown}. You can use
anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation
\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).

The \textbf{bookdown} package can be installed from CRAN or Github:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\OperatorTok{>}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"bookdown"}\NormalTok{)}
\OperatorTok{>}\StringTok{ }\CommentTok{# or the development version}
\ErrorTok{>}\StringTok{ }\CommentTok{# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter
is defined by the first-level heading \texttt{\#}.

To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to
install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX):
\url{https://yihui.name/tinytex/}.

\subsection{Intro of the minimal book
example}\label{intro-of-the-minimal-book-example}

You can label chapter and section titles using \texttt{\{\#label\}}
after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \ref{intro}. If you do not
manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g.,
Chapter \ref{methods}.

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in \texttt{figure} and
\texttt{table} environments, respectively.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\OperatorTok{>}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{par}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{mar =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{, .}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, .}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{))}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{badges4edu_files/figure-latex/nice-fig-1} 

}

\caption{Here is a nice figure!}\label{fig:nice-fig}
\end{figure}

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the \texttt{fig:}
prefix, e.g., see Figure \ref{fig:nice-fig}. Similarly, you can
reference tables generated from \texttt{knitr::kable()}, e.g., see Table
\ref{tab:nice-tab}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\OperatorTok{>}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{knitr}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{kable}\NormalTok{(}

\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}

5.1 & 3.8 & 1.5 & 0.3 & setosa\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the
\textbf{bookdown} package \citep{R-bookdown} in this sample book, which
was built on top of R Markdown and \textbf{knitr} \citep{xie2015}.

\subsection{Install stackr with
vignettes}\label{install-stackr-with-vignettes}

Building vignettes takes some time. So if you are in a hurry, than just
install stackr. You can still look at the vignettes in R help. The
difference is: With \texttt{build\_vignettes\ =\ TRUE} and then
\texttt{browseVignettes("stackr")} you can look at the vignettes in your
default browser. This is slightly more comfortable.

\section{Load several packages at
once}\label{load-several-packages-at-once}

The following code is part of a debate at SO with different suggestions.
It seems to me, that all suggestions (utility packages, code examples)
has some disadvantages:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{lapply:} For me the
  \href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8175912/load-multiple-packages-at-once}{best}
  approach -- it uses just \texttt{lapply}. I have changed
  \texttt{require} to \texttt{library} because of the arguments by
  \href{https://yihui.name/en/2014/07/library-vs-require/}{Yihui}. My
  lines now gives a error message and stops if one of the called
  packages is not installed.
\item
  \textbf{easypackages:} is not available on CRAN anymore, has very poor
  downloads.
\item
  \textbf{pacman:} a very sophisticated programm, but -- for me at least
  -- to complex and therefore to much overhead.
\item
  \textbf{installed.packages:}
  \href{https://gist.github.com/stevenworthington/3178163}{ipak.R} This
  loads \emph{and} installs missing packages. It is quite similar as
  \texttt{lappy}-version, but -- because of the if-condition -- more
  complex. Additionally it is checking which packages are installed:
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
``This can be slow when thousands of packages are installed, so do not
use this to find out if a named package is installed (use system.file or
find.package) nor to find out if a package is usable (call require and
check the return value) \ldots{}''
\end{quote}

So maybe the best would be to combine the \texttt{lapply} with the
\texttt{installled.packages} version. But insted to use
\texttt{installled.packages} I should use in the if-statement
\texttt{require}, check for the return value and -- if necessary -- to
install missing packages.
