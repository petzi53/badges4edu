\chapter{Badges in Stack Overflow}\label{badges-in-stack-overflow}

\section{The Stack Exchange Network}\label{the-stack-exchange-network}

\subsection{172 Websites with Stack Overflow as
Showpiece}\label{websites-with-stack-overflow-as-showpiece}

Why I am using Stack Overflow as my primary example to investigate the
usefulness of badges in education?

\href{https://stackoverflow.com/}{Stack Overflow} is a very successful
Question and Answer (Q\&A) website. It hosts the world's largest
programming community and is still growing. Stack Overflow occupies
about the 60th position in the world rankings of websites. Currently
(June 2018) it has 8.9 million registered user with 16 million questions
and 25 million answers. There are already clones in different languages
(Russian , Japanese, Spanish and Portuguese) whose user basis at least
are partially to add.

But Stack Overflow is just the
\href{https://stackexchange.com/sites\#traffic}{flagship of
StackExchange}, a network of (currently) 173 Q\&A websites, following
the same principles for community management. With this high number of
Q\&A websites for different issues and target groups it is allowed to
assume that at least some principles of the successful community
management of programmer are not only restricted to technical subjects
but can be transferred to other areas as well. One can see from the
\href{https://stackexchange.com/sites?view=grid\#}{graphical
represenation} of the Stack Exchange sites that technology, ``hard
sciences'' like mathematics, physics, chemistry dominate the network.
But there are also websites on philosophy, language learning and even
websites addressing recreational issues like bicycles, chess and beer,
wine \& spirits.

\begin{quote}
Stack Exchange network consists of 173 Q\&A communities including Stack
Overflow, the largest, most trusted online community for developers to
learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers. (Quote from the
Stack Overflow website) \footnote{This quote apears in a little window
  when you are on the \href{https://meta.stackexchange.com}{meta site}
  and you click in the StackExchange banner left from the search field.
  But actually in my downloaded data I found just 172 websites. On the
  about site of \href{https://stackexchange.com/about}{StackExchange}
  however I have seen outdated information from the year 2015 (Today:
  25th May 2018). You can find another summary of the astonishing
  success story of StackOverflow from a business perspective on the
  \href{https://stackoverflow.com/company}{company page of
  StackOverflow}. -- It is sometimes difficult for me to find the right
  place for some information because of the complex clutter of (similar)
  sites on different levels (site and meta site).}
\end{quote}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{``Graduates'' Websites and Websites on Trial
(Beta)}{Graduates Websites and Websites on Trial (Beta)}}\label{graduates-websites-and-websites-on-trial-beta}

\subsection{Stack Exchange Websites by
Subject}\label{stack-exchange-websites-by-subject}

\section{Dynamics of the Stack Exchange
Community}\label{dynamics-of-the-stack-exchange-community}

But before to look into these other websites one should grasp the
community dynamics of the most successful member of the network.

All Stack Exchange websites are based of a complex interplay between
different elements:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Scores (``reputation'' points)} are earned through positive
  votes by peers for posting useful answers but also for asking
  questions, if they show research effort and their underlying problems
  are reproducible.
\item
  \textbf{Badges} as digital token in form of emblems. They are awarded
  by the system either for fulfilling certain tasks or reaching a
  certain amount of community awareness.
\item
  \textbf{Priviliges} are granted when certain thresholds or milestones
  of reputation points are transcended. Each privilege opens up a
  specified user rights in relation to the website.
\end{enumerate}

I am convinced that the study of user interactions of Stack Overflow can
be very helpful to understand the success factors for a prosperous
community building process. To study user behavior and their reactions
to the rules and framework of Stack Overflow one can learn not only much
about the effects of gamification elements (e.g.~the interplay between
reputation points and badges) but also how communities of practice work.

Besides the common review of literature my research in this paper is
based on four sources:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{\href{https://stackoverflow.com/}{Stack Overflow}:} Clearly
  enough this has to be one of my chief source of information.
\item
  \textbf{\href{http://api.stackexchange.com/}{Stack Exchance API}:} The
  Stack Exchange network provides an Application Programming Interface
  (API) where one can download data for answering research question.
\item
  \textbf{\href{https://meta.stackoverflow.com/}{Meta Stack Overflow}:}
  This website is especially dedicated to Q\&A \emph{about} Stack
  Overflow itself. The discussion on this website is an important
  resource on qualitative data to my research question.
\item
  \textbf{\href{https://meta.stackexchange.com/}{Meta Stack Exchange}:}
  Another for meta-discussion. This time for the whole Stack Exchange
  family of Q\&A websites, so to speak the meta-meta-website of the
  Stack Overflow website.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Categorization of Badges}\label{categorization-of-badges}

I need to download all types of badges with their description and for
further investigation to categorize them.

\subsection{Badges for different
activities}\label{badges-for-different-activities}

The badges are grouped according to the necessary activities to get
them. The long version what you have to do to get a a specific badge is
posted on meta.stackexchance.com under the title:
\href{https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/67397/list-of-all-badges-with-full-descriptions}{List
of all badges with full descriptions}. A short and more readable version
can be seen on \href{https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges}{help page
for badges}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  Question badges
\item
  Answer badges
\item
  Participation badges
\item
  Moderation badges
\item
  Other badges
\item
  Documentation badges
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Badges from different
sources}\label{badges-from-different-sources}

Another differentiation is the point of origin the badges come from.
Even though all badges are generated automatically by the system, there
are two principal sources to get them. There are two different entities
responsible for awarding badges.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There are badges you can get by just doing a certain action once or a
  needed number of times. * And there are badges you get only after some
  community action.
\end{itemize}

I call the first type \texttt{user} and the second type \texttt{peer}
badges.

\textbf{Examples for \texttt{user} badges:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Name: ``Civic Duty'' (Vote 300 times).
\item
  Name: ``Enthusiast'' (Visit the site each day for 30 consecutive day)
\end{itemize}

Some of the \texttt{user} badges are only available after some threshold
value is reached and a certain privileges is granted. For instance
voting up needs 15 and voting down 125 reputation points.

\textbf{Examples for \texttt{peer} badges:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Name: ``Favorite Question'' (Question favored by 25 users)
\item
  Name: ``Popular Question'' (Question with 1000 views).
\end{itemize}

There are also badges tied with certain events, like moderator election,
working with the beta version, meeting employees at an event etc. Mostly
these badges are in my categorization \texttt{user} badges, but you
cannot get them at any time, even if you would have the required
privileges.

The badge system of Stack Overflow is a dynamic system. When the website
was launched (September 15, 2008) it did not start with all 91 badges
which are listed today (May 21, 2018). Some of the badges were added
during the history of the website but other are not awarded anymore.
Some of those badges which are not functional anymore are retired badges
(e.g. ``Analytical'', for visiting all sections of the FAQ). This means
you will still see some veteran users with these badges. Other badges
(all three documentation badges for instance) are withdrawn, e.g.~they
were even deleted from those user accounts they were awarded earlier. I
call these two groups of badges \texttt{event} and \texttt{dead} badges.

To sum up there are 4 points of origin for badges:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  Badges from user action = \texttt{user} badges
\item
  Badges from community action = \texttt{peer} badges
\item
  Badges from some action during a specified occurrence = \texttt{event}
  badges
\item
  Badges where the point of origin is not interesting anymore as they
  are now non-functional = \texttt{dead} badges
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Badges with different degrees of
difficulty}\label{badges-with-different-degrees-of-difficulty}

Badges are ranked by their difficulty. According to their level of
difficulty users are awarded with bronze (relatively easy), silver
(moderately difficult) or gold (difficult) badges.

There are badges with the same action required but with different amount
of repetition. User can see those groups of badges separated by lines on
the \href{https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges}{Stack Overflow
website}. On this page one can also inspect how many time each badge was
awarded.

There is also a special group of badges intimately linked with
reputation of the user's expertise. These \texttt{Tag\ Badges} also come
with different degrees of difficulty.

I will focus in my research on those badges where users are mainly
responsible. Those are the badges where I can show if users are
motivated to strive for them.

\textbf{Visit the site each day for {[}\ldots{}{]} consecutive days.
(Days are counted in UTC.)}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  30 (Enthusiast)
\item
  100 (Fanatic)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Ask a well-received question {[}\ldots{}{]} and maintain a
positive question record}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  on 5 separate days (Curious)
\item
  on 30 separate days (Inquisitativ)
\item
  on 100 separate days (Socratic)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Complete at least {[}\ldots{}{]}. This badge is awarded once per
review type}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  one review task (Custodian)
\item
  250 review tasks (Reviewer)
\item
  1000 review tasks (Steward)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Edit and answer {[}\ldots{}{]} (both actions within 12 hours,
answer score \textgreater{} 0)}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  1 question (Explainer)
\item
  50 questions (Refiner)
\item
  500 questions (Illuminator)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Edit}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  first post (Editor)
\item
  80 posts (Strunk \& White)
\item
  500 posts (Copy Editor)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Edit {[}\ldots{}{]} that was inactive for 6 months}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  first post (Excavator)
\item
  100 posts (Archaeologist)
\end{itemize}

The \texttt{user} badges are of utmost importance for my research. Most
of these badges are granted for quality assurance work on the website
and are not linked with reputation points. They are -- from a systemic
perspective -- important for the dynamic of the website and maintain
respective raise the quality of the platform and their ecological
sustainability.

When I can show that people are striving to get \texttt{user} badges --
even when they are not linked with reputation points -- than it is
evident that badges are some additional (motivational) factors for the
community development.
