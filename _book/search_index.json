["badges-in-stackoverflow.html", "Chapter 3 Badges in StackOverflow 3.1 Categorization of Badges", " Chapter 3 Badges in StackOverflow 3.1 Categorization of Badges I need to download all types of badges with their description and for further investigation to categorize them. 3.1.1 Badges for different activities The badges are grouped according to the necessary activities to get them. The different types of badges can be seen on help page for badges: Question badges Answer badges Partication badges Moderation badges Other badges Documentation badges 3.1.2 Badges from different sources Another differentiation is the point of origin the badges come from. Even though all badges are generated automatically by the system, there are two principal sources to get them. There are two different entities responsible for awarding badges. There are badges you can get by just doing a certain action once or a needed number of times. And there are badges you get only after some community action. I call the first type user and the second type community badges. Examples for user badges: Name: “Civic Duty” (Vote 300 times). Name: “Enthusiast” (Visit the site each day for 30 consecutive day) Some of the user badges are only available after some threshold value is reached and a certain privileges is granted. For instance voting up needs 15 and voting down 125 reputation points. Examples for community badges: Name: “Favorite Question” (Question favored by 25 users) Name: “Popular Question” (Question with 1000 views). There are also badges tied with certain events, like moderator election, working with the beta version, meeting employees at an event etc. Mostly these badges are in my categorization user badges, but you cannot get them at any time, even if you would have the required privileges. The badge system of Stack Overflow is a dynamic system. When the website was launched (Spetember 15, 2008) it did not start with all 91 badges which are listed today (May 21, 2018). Some of the badges were added during the history of the website but other are not awared anymore. Some of those badges which are not functional anymore are retired badges (e.g. “Analytical”, for visiting all sections of the FAQ). This means you will still see some veteran users with these badges. Other badges (all three documentation badges for instance) are withdrawn, e.g. they were even deleted from those user accounts they were awarded earlier. I call these two groups of badges event and dead badges. To sum up there are 4 point of origins for badges: Badges from user action = user badges Badges from community action = community badges Badges from some action during a specified occurence = event badges Badges where the point of origin is not interesting anymore as they are now non-funtional = dead badges Table 3.1: Badges in Stack Overflow ID Name Count Rank Activity Origin Description 1 222 Altruist 8158 bronze Question User First bounty you manually award on another person&amp;#39;s question 2 1306 Analytical 43743 bronze Other Dead Visited every section of the FAQ (retired) 3 260 Announcer 131289 bronze Other Community Share a link to a question later visited by 25 unique IP addresses 4 1286 Archaeologist 1883 silver Moderation User Edit 100 posts that were inactive for 6 months 5 9 Autobiographer 799567 bronze Participation User Complete &amp;quot;About Me&amp;quot; section of user profile 6 221 Benefactor 38879 bronze Question User First bounty you manually award on your own question 7 30 Beta 2510 silver Participation Event Voted 10 times, added 3 posts score &amp;gt; 0, and visited the site on 3 separate days during the private beta 8 261 Booster 3234 silver Other Community Share a link to a question later visited by 300 unique IP addresses 9 1973 Caucus 573681 bronze Participation Event Visit an &lt;a href=“https://stackoverflow.com/election”&gt;election&lt;/a&gt; during any phase of an active election and have enough reputation to cast a vote 10 6644 Census 71168 silver Other Event Completed the annual Stack Overflow survey; your responses are anonymous 11 8 Citizen Patrol 177509 bronze Moderation User First flagged post 12 32 Civic Duty 80312 silver Moderation User Vote 300 or more times 13 4 Cleanup 40887 bronze Moderation User First rollback 14 31 Commentator 799870 bronze Participation User Leave 10 comments 15 3108 Constable 0 gold Moderation Event Served as a pro-tem moderator for at least 1 year or through site graduation 16 1974 Constituent 186464 silver Participation Event Vote for a candidate in the final phase of an &lt;a href=“https://stackoverflow.com/election”&gt;election&lt;/a&gt; 17 901 Convention 2041 silver Participation Community 10 posts with score of 2 on &lt;a href=“https://meta.stackoverflow.com”&gt;meta&lt;/a&gt; 18 223 Copy Editor 2807 gold Moderation User Edit 500 posts (excluding own or deleted posts and tag edits) 19 7 Critic 337868 bronze Moderation User First down vote 20 4127 Curious 283493 bronze Question User Ask a well-received question on 5 separate days, and maintain a positive question record 21 2278 Custodian 660176 bronze Moderation User Complete at least one &lt;a href=“https://stackoverflow.com/review”&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; task.

According to their level of difficulty users are awared with bronze (relatively easy), silver (moderately difficult) or gold (difficult) badges. User can see those groups of badges separated by lines on the Stack Overflow website. On this page one can also inspect how many time each badge was awarded. There is also a special group of badges intimately linked with reputation of the user’s expertise. These Tag Badges also come with different degrees of difficulty. I will focus in my research on those badges where users are mainly responsible. Those are the badges where I can show if users are motivated to strive for them. Visit the site each day for […] consecutive days. (Days are counted in UTC.) 30 (Enthusiast) 100 (Fanatic) Ask a well-received question […] and maintain a positive question record on 5 separate days (Curious) on 30 separate days (Inquisitativ) on 100 separate days (Socratic) Complete at least […]. This badge is awarded once per review type one review task (Custodian) 250 review tasks (Reviewer) 1000 review tasks (Steward) Edit and answer […] (both actions within 12 hours, answer score &gt; 0) 1 question (Explainer) 50 questions (Refiner) 500 questions (Illuminator) Edit first post (Editor) 80 posts (Strunk &amp; White) 500 posts (Copy Editor) Edit […] that was inactive for 6 months first post (Excavator) 100 posts (Archeologist) The user badges are of utmost importance for my research. Most of these badges are granted for quality assurance work on the website and are not linked with reputation points. They are – from a systemic perspective – important for the dynamic of the website and maintain respective raise the qualitiy of the platform and their ecological sustainability. When I can show that people are striving to get user badges – even when they are not linked with reputation points – than it is evident that badges are some additional (motivational) factors for the community development.

You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: &gt; install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) &gt; # or the development version &gt; # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. 7.1.2 Intro of the minimal book example You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. &gt; par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) &gt; plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 7.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 7.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 7.1. &gt; knitr::kable( + head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, + booktabs = TRUE + ) Table 7.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2018) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). 7.2 My own (miscellanous) tests 7.2.1 Install stackr with vignettes Building vignettes takes some time. So if you are in a hurry, than just install stackr. You can still look at the vignettes in R help. The difference is: With build_vignettes = TRUE and then browseVignettes(&quot;stackr&quot;) you can look at the vignettes in your default browser. This is slightly more comfortable. &gt; devtools::install_github(&quot;dgrtwo/stackr&quot;, build_vignettes = TRUE) &gt; browseVignettes(&quot;stackr&quot;) 7.3 Load several packages at once The following code is part of a debate at SO with different suggestions. It seems to me, that all suggestions (utility packages, code examples) has some disadvantages: lapply: For me the best approach – it uses just lapply. I have changed require to library because of the arguments by Yihui. My lines now gives a error message and stops if one of the called packages is not installed. easypackages: is not available on CRAN anymore, has very poor downloads. pacman: a very sophisticated programm, but – for me at least – to complex and therefore to much overhead. installed.packages: ipak.R This loads and installs missing packages. It is quite similar as lappy-version, but – because of the if-condition – more complex. Additionally it is checking which packages are installed: “This can be slow when thousands of packages are installed, so do not use this to find out if a named package is installed (use system.file or find.package) nor to find out if a package is usable (call require and check the return value) …” So maybe the best would be to combine the lapply with the installled.packages version. But insted to use installled.packages I should use in the if-statement require, check for the return value and – if necessary – to install missing packages. &gt; x &lt;- c(&quot;plyr&quot;, &quot;psych&quot;, &quot;tm&quot;) &gt; lapply(x, library, character.only = TRUE) 7.3.1 How many downloads of a defined packages? &gt; library(dlstats) &gt; y &lt;- cran_stats(&quot;learnr&quot;) &gt; ggplot(y, aes(start, downloads, group = package, color = package)) + + geom_line() + geom_point(aes(shape = package)) &gt; # cranApp() 7.4 Some data to remind How to find answers tagged with r and not active since 6 month: Search What kind of actions are are allowed with combine_url? I have added timeline to the list! 7.4.1 Some experiments "]
